# Rust RX & TX TCP Connection
TCP Server -> Client (accepts multiple clients) Chat Connection with Rust <br>
This is kinda the same concept for a TCP Server-Victim/Client Reverse Shell that I've been using/will use on <br>
other projects and I decided it was high time to add to my GitHub repo as a demo. <br>

- On Server console, start the server first:
```console
~/chat/server/ $ cargo run
```

- On Client console:
```console
~/chat/client/ $ cargo run
```
